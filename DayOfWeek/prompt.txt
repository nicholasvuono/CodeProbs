**Day Of Week**

Days of the week are represented as three letter strings
("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun").

Write a function that given a string of S representing the day of the week and an integer K
(between 0 and 500), returns the day of the week that is K days later.

For example, given S = "Wed" and K = 2, the function should return "Fri".
Given S = "Sat" and K = 23, the function should return "Mon".
