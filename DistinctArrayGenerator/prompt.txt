**Distinct Array Generator**

Write a function

class Solution { public int[] solution(int n); }

that, when given an integer N(1<= N <= 100), returns an array containing N distinct integers that
sum up to 0. The function can return any such array.

For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1, 0, -3, 2], and for N = 3 one of the possible
answers is [1, 0, -1] (but there are many more correct answers).
